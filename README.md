This project applies advanced Topological Data Analysis (TDA) techniques to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Using multiple directional height and radial filtrations, it extracts rich topological features via persistent homology, then transforms these features with entropy and amplitude metrics.

A Random Forest classifier is trained on these topological features, achieving strong accuracy and F1 score on a challenging, limited training set.

Big credit to Giotto-TDA for the filtration/feature ideas
